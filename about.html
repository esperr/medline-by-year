		<h2>Why PubMed by Year?</h2>
    <p>The biomedical literature is a not only a tool for finding the newest answers, but is also a record of what researchers and clinicians
      have concerned themselves with over the decades. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">PubMed</a> now generates a graph showing reults by year for a search, but this may not
      show actual trends given that the <a href="https://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/medline_cit_counts_yr_pub.html">astonishing increase</a> of the biomedical literature over time makes a simple count less illustrative of changes
      for any given search.</p>
      <p>For exmaple, here are graphs of raw counts for the searches 'Diabetes mellitus, type 2', 'Malaria' and '“Heart diseases[mesh]”':
      <img src="yearcount_examples.png" alt="individual searches" style="margin: 1em">

      <p>All three show a steep increase, but it is hard to discern what this means given the background increase in items. However, if we <em>compare</em> those yearly totals to those for PubMed as a whole and lay them out on the
        same graph, a clearer picture of publication trends emerges:</p>

    <h2>How it works</h2>
      <p>PubMed</a> does a thorough job of covering the vast biomedical literature, as it contains citations from around
       <a href="https://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/serfile_addedinfo.html">26,000 journals</a> published around the world. Within PubMed, the MEDLINE database provides thorough coverage of this literature <a href="https://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/medline.html">from 1966 onwards</a>
       and OLDMEDLINE take us <a href="https://www.nlm.nih.gov/databases/databases_oldmedline.html">back to 1946</a> for some parts of the literature. There are also a relative smattering of
       <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/">PubMed Central</a> citations between the nineteenth century and the present.</p>
       <p>Yearly counts for each search are taken from PubMed and compared to year-by-year totals. Hits per 100,000 by year are calculated by the following formula:</p>
       <p>
         \[ {\text{Number of search results that year} \over \text{Total number of PubMed results that year} } \times 100000.\]
       </p>

    <h2>Caveats</h2>
      <p>When you enter a search into the search bar, you are searching PubMed directly, meaning that your search is parsed by NCBI's <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK3827/#pubmedhelp.How_PubMed_works_automatic_te">automatic term mapping</a>
        algorithm. If something doesn't make sense, you can try your search in a new PubMed window (or click any year on the graph) and examine the "Details" from the Advanced Search Builder page.</p>
        <p>Use caution when interpreting the results of a <a href="https://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/meshhome.html">
        Medical Subject Heading</a> search, as older records are not typically re-indexed after a new heading is added to the thesaurus.</p>

  	<h3>Technologies</h3>
		<p>PubMed by Year is lashed together with bailing wire and <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>. NCBI does not have an easy way to grab by-year counts for a search (short of launching 50+ calls to the API), so a <a href="https://github.com/esperr/med-by-year">custom webservice</a>
      is used to fetch them. <a href="https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/linechart">Google Charts</a> is used to draw the charts and responsive layout is made easier with <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>.</p>
    <p>You can find the source code for this application at <a href="https://github.com/esperr/pubmed-by-year">GitHub</a>.</p>
